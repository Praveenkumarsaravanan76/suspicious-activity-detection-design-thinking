# Suspicious Activity Detection – Design Thinking

## Problem Statement
How can suspicious activity be detected without constantly alarming genuine users?

## Reason
False alerts reduce user trust and create frustration. Constant warnings may cause genuine users to ignore real threats. The goal is to balance security and user experience by detecting risks silently and alerting users only when necessary.

## Proposed Approach
- Monitor user behavior patterns
- Use risk-based analysis instead of constant alerts
- Trigger verification only when abnormal activity is detected
- Keep messages friendly and non-alarming

## Tools Used
- Trello (task planning & design thinking)
- Figma (basic UI exploration)
